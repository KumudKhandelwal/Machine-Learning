Playing with a neural network in pytorch: non-linear regression
  1. Non-linear regression with a neural network
  2. Neural network with full implementation (gradient computation and estimate update)
  3. Neural network with automatic gradient computation (but still the explicit estimate update)
  4. Neural network with automatic gradient computation and automatic estimate update
